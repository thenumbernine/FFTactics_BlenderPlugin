## Final Fantasy Tactics Blender Importer

This is modified heavily from the JustinMarshall98 Ganesha Python version, which itself was modified from the Gomtuu Ganesha Python version.
It was convenient that Blender plugins are written in Python.

# Installing

To get it working, copy the folder structure into your Blender user path.
If you don't know where that is then follow this link:

https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/advanced/blender_directory_layout.html

Once it is copied, next go to Edit -> Preferences -> Add-Ons, then scroll down or filter by the word 'GNS', and you should see the plug-in:

Click the checkbox and you should now find a new option under File -> Import:

![step 2](ex2.png)

# Progress

Right now it just imports the mesh as-is.

Maybe later I'll get fancy with multiple palettes and other stuff.
