## Final Fantasy Tactics Blender Importer

This is modified heavily from the JustinMarshall98 Ganesha Python version, which itself was modified from the Gomtuu Ganesha Python version.
It was convenient that Blender plugins are written in Python.

To get it working, copy the folder structure into your Blender user path.
If you don't know where that is then follow this link:

https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/advanced/blender_directory_layout.html

Right now it just imports the mesh as-is.

Maybe later I'll get fancy with multiple palettes and other stuff.
